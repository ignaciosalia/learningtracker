## Update of learning progress
17 -02 -2021
This week I finish the freecodecamp Javascript and Data Structures I feel greate and this is very important step for me and I feel more confident in my work and my hability to work and dedicate time to learn and build new proyects, right now I'm working in front end Libraries.
So let's continue working and continue improving my coding :P

## I have notice some update us necesary
19-02-2021
Working with JQuery and trying some of the things I learned in freecodecademy I have notice that I need to practice more outside frecodecademy so I can experiment the changes that has happend with JQuery, animate.css and SASS so I can actually be working with industry standards

## SASS And the case I have to learnd more
20-02-2021
Today I finish frecodecamp SASS introduction an I think I need to practice more with it so I can see how usefull it is, by the moment I don't know how I'm gonna work with it or in what cases I'm gonna use it, feels like for the moment kind of "meh" 


## React
21-02-2021
Starting to learn React I'm excited about this library
SASS I found to make it work in real life outside tutorial some configuration is require, the happends with JQuery I have already start playing with this and is fun 

23-02-2021
I have decide to build my new portfolio using React, I think is the best way to do it and practice this new tool, I hope by Sunday have some work done 

25-02-2021
I work in something else than my programming I start late and I didn't update my github yesterday, my bad I will continue working and not allowing again to pass a day without updating
