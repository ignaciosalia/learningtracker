## I have notice some update us necesary
19-02-2021
Working with JQuery and trying some of the things I learned in freecodecademy I have notice that I need to practice more outside frecodecademy so I can experiment the changes that has happend with JQuery, animate.css and SASS so I can actually be working with industry standards

## SASS And the case I have to learnd more
20-02-2021
Today I finish frecodecamp SASS introduction an I think I need to practice more with it so I can see how usefull it is, by the moment I don't know how I'm gonna work with it or in what cases I'm gonna use it, feels like for the moment kind of "meh" 


## React
