## Update of learning progress
17 -02 -2021
This week I finish the freecodecamp Javascript and Data Structures I feel greate and this is very important step for me and I feel more confident in my work and my hability to work and dedicate time to learn and build new proyects, right now I'm working in front end Libraries.
So let's continue working and continue improving my coding :P

## I have notice some update us necesary
19-02-2021
Working with JQuery and trying some of the things I learned in freecodecademy I have notice that I need to practice more outside frecodecademy so I can experiment the changes that has happend with JQuery, animate.css and SASS so I can actually be working with industry standards

## SASS And the case I have to learnd more
20-02-2021
Today I finish frecodecamp SASS introduction an I think I need to practice more with it so I can see how usefull it is, by the moment I don't know how I'm gonna work with it or in what cases I'm gonna use it, feels like for the moment kind of "meh" 


## React
21-02-2021
Starting to learn React I'm excited about this library
SASS I found to make it work in real life outside tutorial some configuration is require, the happends with JQuery I have already start playing with this and is fun 

23-02-2021

# 17-03-2021
Well alot has change but still not a job, I had one interview last week tuesday 13 and I blow it horribly, I didn't remember what a pure javascript function is (is function that given the same input it will always return the same result), also I didn't remember what a modular design pattern is and for what is use (is a design pattern that subdivides the parts of a system into smaller parts called modules, each module is easy to maintain and build by individuals, this modules are easier to test then this parts are out together, also this design pattern make agile systems and apps). In my interview also I didn't remember what AJAX is (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML is a set of techniques using many web technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications, as the example of google guess word), and also what a bloody Arrow function is, and really hate my self for it. 
But I really give me the opportunity of something, to learn and to see I need to study more theory and practice more, create more projects and make everyone who want to test me see of what I'm capable of, to show and all my creativity and abilities. 
I fail my self for the last time. 


# 7-06-2021
As we say in Mexico "Not dead, Only was in a party" well not a party I'm been working a lot in my new portfolio and trying to get a job as a front end developer, well I been reading and learning a lot more in deep React. This is a the path I choose, and I hope soon get a job, and write here very soon that I'm officialy working to improve my skills everyday. 

# 13-06-2021
Work and family are two things that sometimes are in conflict, I don't know how to balance them, I feel sometimes I put family infront of work no matter if doing this will affect my pocket but anyway, I have started to tackle daily JavaScript challenges, and to create a new look to my portfolio instead of try to sell what I think the industry wants I will sell who I'm, and see what happend the worst is I don't get a job :P
